Large Language Model (LLM)
Welcome to the Large Language Model (LLM) repository! This repository contains code for training and using a large language model based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformer architectures.

Overview
The Large Language Model is designed to generate text based on the patterns and structures learned from a given dataset. It can be used for various natural language processing tasks such as text generation, language translation, and sentiment analysis.

Features
Train a language model on custom text data
Fine-tune pre-trained language models for specific tasks
Generate text based on user input or prompts
Evaluate the performance of the language model using metrics such as perplexity
Getting Started
To get started with the Large Language Model, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/anesu398/Large-Language-Model.git
Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your text data in a suitable format (e.g., a text file).
Train the language model using the provided scripts or notebooks.
Use the trained model to generate text or perform other natural language processing tasks.
Usage
To use the Large Language Model for text generation, follow these steps:

Load the trained model and vocabulary:
python
Copy code
# Load the model
model = load_model('language_model.h5')

# Load the vocabulary
vocab = np.load('vocab.npy', allow_pickle=True).item()
Generate text using the model:
python
Copy code
# Generate text
input_text = "The quick brown fox"
generated_text = generate_text(model, vocab, input_text, length=100)
print(generated_text)
